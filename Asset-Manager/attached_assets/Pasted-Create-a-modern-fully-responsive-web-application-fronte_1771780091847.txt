Create a modern, fully responsive web application frontend called “Bharat Heritage Explorer”, a cultural education platform that inspires awareness of Indian culture, heritage, historical places, and famous monuments. The application should be built using React (Vite or Next.js), Tailwind CSS for styling, React Router for navigation, and Framer Motion for smooth animations. The design must feel premium and immersive, like a National Geographic–style storytelling platform blended with interactive travel experiences. Use an Indian-inspired color palette including saffron, royal blue, gold, and white, with elegant typography such as Playfair Display for headings and Poppins for body text. The app must support light and dark mode, be fully mobile responsive, and include smooth transitions, glassmorphism cards, soft shadows, loading skeletons, toast notifications, and subtle Indian decorative patterns.

The landing page should feature an animated hero section with iconic Indian monument visuals in the background, a bold title “Discover the Soul of India,” a subtitle encouraging exploration of culture and heritage, and call-to-action buttons such as Explore Monuments, Start Virtual Tour, and Join as Cultural Enthusiast. Include an interactive SVG map of India where users can hover and click on states, a featured monuments carousel, cultural quote of the day section, and animated scroll effects. Implement authentication pages for login and signup with modern UI design and a role selection dropdown including Admin, Cultural Enthusiast, Content Creator, and Tour Guide. Forms should include validation and social login buttons (UI only, no backend implementation required).

Create role-based dashboards with protected routes and mock data. The Admin dashboard should include overview statistics cards (total users, monuments, tours, discussions), user management features (view users, change roles, ban users), content management (add, edit, delete monuments, approve creator submissions), analytics charts, discussion moderation, notifications, sidebar navigation, and dark mode toggle. The Cultural Enthusiast dashboard should allow users to explore monuments by state, era, and category (Temple, Fort, Palace, UNESCO site), bookmark favorites, join virtual tours, participate in cultural discussion forums, take quizzes to earn badges, view a leaderboard, access a 360° virtual tour viewer, and manage their profile with achievement history. The Content Creator dashboard should allow creating and editing monument entries including title, description, historical timeline, images, videos, fun facts, interactive quizzes, and virtual tour scripts, along with draft and publish workflow, approval status tracking, rich text editor UI, and preview mode. The Tour Guide dashboard should allow hosting live virtual tours, uploading recorded tours, scheduling sessions via calendar interface, managing participants, answering user queries in chat format, viewing tour history, and receiving ratings and feedback.

Each monument detail page should include a large hero image, monument name, location, built year, dynasty, architectural style, UNESCO status badge, interactive historical timeline section, embedded 360° virtual tour section, audio guide player, fun facts section titled “Did You Know?”, related monument suggestions, bookmark button, share button, and discussion/comment section. Include interactive features such as animated India map markers, scroll progress indicator, cultural trivia mini-game, quiz completion badge animation with confetti effect, and immersive fullscreen virtual tour mode. Add a search bar with advanced filters, multilingual UI toggle (English/Hindi), event calendar for cultural festivals, blog section for cultural articles, and an AI chatbot UI labeled “Ask About Indian Heritage.” Use mock data only and include sample monuments such as Taj Mahal, Hampi, Qutub Minar, Konark Sun Temple, Red Fort, and Meenakshi Temple with placeholder images.

Ensure proper folder structure including components, pages, dashboards, layouts, routes, hooks, context, utils, and assets. The final output should be a fully designed frontend with complete routing, dummy data integration, working navigation, animated transitions, role-based UI separation, and visually polished interactive experience. Do not implement backend functionality; focus entirely on creating a high-quality, immersive frontend user interface suitable for a hackathon-winning cultural heritage platform.
